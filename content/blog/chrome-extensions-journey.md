## How It Started

I was frustrated with TikTok watermarks on downloaded videos. Instead of searching for a solution, I decided to build one myself.

## The Extensions

### 1. TikTok Video Downloader (30+ users)

My first extension. Learning the Chrome Extension manifest v3 was a journey, but seeing that first download work was magical.

### 2. AI Slop Blocker (53 users)

With AI-generated content flooding the internet, I built this to help filter it out. Uses pattern matching and ML indicators.

### 3. Twitter Thread Downloader (67 users)

The most popular one! Turns Twitter threads into readable formats. The challenge was handling Twitter's dynamic content loading.

### 4. InstantCurrency (5 users)

A simple but useful currency converter. Taught me about working with financial APIs.

## Key Learnings

1. **Solve your own problems** - You'll understand the use case better
2. **Ship early** - My first versions were rough but worked
3. **Listen to feedback** - Users found bugs I never would have
4. **Keep it simple** - One feature, done well

## Chrome Web Store Tips

- Good icons matter more than you think
- Write clear descriptions
- Screenshots are essential
- Respond to reviews

## Revenue?

These are all free. The goal was learning and helping people, not money. Though I might add optional donations later.
