## The Vision

Ever since I watched Iron Man, I've been fascinated by the idea of having a personal AI assistant. Last month, I finally decided to build my own version of Jarvis.

## Tech Stack

I chose Python for this project because of its excellent AI/ML ecosystem:

- **OpenAI API** - For natural language understanding and generation
- **SpeechRecognition** - For converting voice to text
- **pyttsx3** - For text-to-speech responses
- **Python** - The glue that holds everything together

## The Journey

### Week 1: Basic Voice Commands

Started with simple voice recognition. Getting the microphone to work reliably was harder than expected. Pro tip: always handle the ambient noise adjustment.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

r = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=1)
    audio = r.listen(source)
```

### Week 2: Adding Intelligence

Integrated OpenAI's API to make the responses actually useful. The key was crafting the right system prompt to give Jarvis personality.

### Week 3: Making It Useful

Added practical features:
- Weather updates
- Calendar integration
- Email summaries
- Code assistance

## What I Learned

1. **Start simple** - Get voice recognition working first
2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Network issues, API limits, unclear speech
3. **Test in real conditions** - Your quiet room isn't real life

## What's Next

Planning to add:
- Smart home integration
- Multi-language support
- Custom wake word detection
